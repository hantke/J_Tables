ChangeOfAngle.py

It changes the vector 'J' in an angle 'Angle' 
in a random direction.

###########################################
ChangeOfDir.py

It changes the vector 'J' in an angle 'Angle'.
For a large sample of vectors, the average
change of direction of the vector will be
'DIR'.

###########################################
Main_Table.py

It changes the vector 'J' in an angle 'Angle'.
For a large sample of vectors, the average
change of direction of the vector will be
'DIR'. The value of 'Angle' and the value 
of 'DIR' are calculated from the change of
mass that affects the halo (dm/M), the change
of Mc(z) in which this change of mass occurs
(dlogMc) and the mass of the halo (M).
